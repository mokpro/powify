It allows you to easily install, update, and manage pow and pow applications seamlessly. To get started, read the installation section below.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nInstall powify using the `gem` command:\r\n\r\n    gem install powify\r\n\r\nImportant Notes\r\n---------------\r\nPowify assumes that your current working directory has the same basename as Pow app. For example, if my site was in:\r\n\r\n    /Users/sethvargo/Development/my_site\r\n\r\nPowify would expect the name of the Pow app to also be `my_site` (the name of the symlink). This is the default behavior if you just use the command `powify create`. However, it's feasible that you would want a different name that the folder. If this is the case, you'll always need to specify the name of the application like this:\r\n\r\n    powify restart foo\r\n    powify destroy foo\r\n    powify move foo new_foo\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\nQ: But Seth, why don't you just search the `~/.pow` directory and grab the symlink that points to the current directory?\r\n\r\nA: Because it's inefficient and it could cause a problem if the same Pow apps are symlinked multiple times under different names, Powify could accidentally perform an operation on the wrong one.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Why don't you just add a hidden file to the project directory when someone creates the app, then you'll know what the symlinked is named.\r\n\r\nA: What happens when the same app is symlinked multiple times under a different name? I also hate when applications create files randomly on my hard drive.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n```bash\r\nSERVER COMMANDS\r\n  powify server install            install pow server\r\n  powify server reinstall          reinstall pow server\r\n  powify server update             update pow server\r\n  powify server uninstall          uninstall pow server\r\n  powify server list               list all pow apps\r\n  powify server start              start the pow server\r\n  powify server stop               stop the pow server\r\n  powify server restart            restart the pow server\r\n  powify server host               adds all pow apps to /etc/hosts file\r\n  powify server unhost             removes all pow apps from /etc/hosts file\r\n  powify server status             print the current server status\r\n  powify server config             print the current server configuration\r\n  powify server logs               tails the pow server logs\r\n\r\nUTILS COMMANDS\r\n  powify utils install             install powify.dev server management tool\r\n  powify utils reinstall           reinstall powify.dev server management tool\r\n  powify utils uninstall           uninstall powify.dev server management tool\r\n\r\nAPP COMMANDS\r\n  powify create [NAME]             creates a pow app from the current directory\r\n  powify destroy [NAME]            destroys the pow app linked to the current directory\r\n  powify restart [NAME]            restarts the pow app linked to the current directory\r\n  powify always_restart [NAME]     reload the pow app after each request\r\n  powify always_restart_off [NAME] do not reload the pow app after each request\r\n  powify rename [NAME]             rename the pow app to [NAME]\r\n  powify rename [OLD] [NEW]        rename the pow app [OLD] to [NEW]\r\n  powify environment [ENV]         run the this pow app in a different environment (aliased `env`)\r\n  powify browse [NAME]             opens and navigates the default browser to this app\r\n  powify logs [NAME]               tail the application logs\r\n```\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n------------\r\n- 9/2 [@lindblom](https://github.com/lindblom) - author of `host` and `unhost`\r\n- 10/29 [@warwickp](https://github.com/warwickp) - wrote `always_restart_off`\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute, fork and send me a pull request.","name":"Powify","google":"UA-12012976-14","tagline":"Powify is an easy-to-use wrapper for 37 signal's pow"}
